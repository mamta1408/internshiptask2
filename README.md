**lets examine the red flags**

***1. Examine sender’s email address***

    Sender: no-reply@support-google.com

    Red flag: This is not a legitimate Google domain. Real Google emails typically come from @google.com, @accounts.google.com, or similar.
    “support-google.com” is a spoofed or lookalike domain meant to trick users.


***2. Check email headers for discrepancies***

    Using an email header analyzer  like:

    MXToolbox Analyzer

    Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader

    IPVoid Email Header Analyzer , one would check:

        SPF/DKIM/DMARC results

        Source IP address (possibly unrelated to Google)

        "Reply-to" address might differ from "From" address

    If found mismatching or originating from unknown servers, this supports spoofing.

 *Analyzing Email Headers for Phishing*
✅ Step 1: Find the Full Email Header
📧  In Gmail:

    Open the suspicious email.

    Click the three vertical dots (More) in the top right of the message.

    Select "Show original."

    A new tab opens with the raw email header and metadata.
 ✅ Step 2: Copy the Full Header
 ✅ Step 3: Use an Online Email Header Analyzer
 🔒 SPF, DKIM, DMARC Results

    ✅ PASS: Good – sender is verified.

    ❌ FAIL: Red flag – sender is not authorized to send emails for the domain.
🌐 Source IP Address    
    
   
 **3. Identify suspicious links or attachments**

    The link says: “Verify My Account Now”

    Hovering over the button would likely reveal a URL not belonging to Google, such as:

    http://secure-google-verification.com/xyz

    Red flag: Legitimate Google verification links always start with https://accounts.google.com/



**4. Look for urgent or threatening language**

    Examples in email:

        “Action Required”

        “Avoid suspension”

        “Failure to verify within this time may result in temporary suspension...”

 *Purpose: Creates panic and urgency, a common phishing tactic to get users to act impulsively.*

**5. Note mismatched URLs**

    The displayed link might look like a Google site, but hovering over it shows something else.

    Example:

        Displayed: https://google.com/verify

        Actual link: http://verify-now.security-checks.io

    Mismatched URLs are a strong sign of phishing.




 **6. Spelling or grammar errors**

    This sample email is written quite cleanly but:

        The phrase “Thank you for choosing Google” is not typical of official Google communication.

        In real emails, the phrasing is usually: “Thanks for using Google,” or “Thanks, Google team.”
   

  **Conclusion:**
                 ** The email we examined  exhibits multiple phishing red flags **
                 
                  Fake Email Address
                  Urgent Language
                  Suspicious Link/Button
                  Generic Greeting
                  Threat of Account Suspension
                  No Personalized Information
                   did not pass the SPF, DKIM, DMARC results


simple precautions you should take to protect yourself from phishing emails:
✅ 1. Check the Sender's Email Address

    Make sure it’s from a legit domain like @google.com, not something odd like @support-google.com.

✅ 2. Don’t Click Suspicious Links or Buttons

    Hover over links to see where they lead before clicking.

    If unsure, go to the website directly by typing the URL yourself (e.g., www.google.com).

✅ 3. Look for Personalization

    Trusted companies use your name, not “Dear User” or “Customer”.

✅ 4. Watch for Urgency or Scare Tactics

    Be cautious of messages that pressure you to act quickly or threaten suspension.

✅ 5. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

    Turn on 2FA on all important accounts for extra security.

✅ 6. Keep Your Software Updated

    Always update your browser, antivirus, and operating system to protect against threats.

✅ 7. Never Share Passwords or OTPs

    No real company will ask for your password or OTP via email or link.

✅ 8. Report Phishing Emails

    In Gmail, click the three dots (⋮) and choose “Report phishing”.

✅ 9. Use a Password Manager

    It helps create strong passwords and can warn you if a website is fake.

✅ 10. Educate Yourself and Others

    Learn about common scams and teach friends/family how to spot phishing emails.
